# Vroom

> Virtual Zoom Teaching Assistant

Vroom is a teaching assistant chatbot that can be used by teachers in Zoom meetings to help improve engagement in virtual classrooms. With a Vroom enabled meeting, students can:

+ Ask questions anonymously to avoid embarassment
+ Discretely ask for help from their teacher
+ Privately suggest the teacher slow down/speed up
+ Translate their questions from any language to English
+ Find out what they should be doing
+ Get access to attendance links

Additionally, with a Vroom enable meeting, teachers can:

+ Efficiently organise polls and look at a detailed breakdown of the responses
+ Keep track of which questions students have completed
+ Manage lesson plans
